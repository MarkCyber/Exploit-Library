<h1 align="center">This is the Exploit Library :) </h1>

**This repository consists of my favorite exploits that were successful when completing various OSCP challenges and labs. This is going to be something I plan on using when it comes to actually take the exam.**

<h3>This is not a completed list. I will slowly be transferring exploits noted in my Obsidian notes to this github repo over time.</h3>

***If you have anything you would like to add, feel free to submit a pull request and explain what section you used it on (for example, section 15.2.5 Q2; or if it's a lab then give the lab name) and provide a screenshot showcasing how it works.***
